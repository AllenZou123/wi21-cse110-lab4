1. The value of i gets printed to the console (which is 3). This is because i is defined using var in the for loop, which means variable i is defined in the scope of the discountPrices funciton itself (var ignores blocks, which is why the variable i is used in the scope of the function).  
2. Similarly to i in the previous question, discountedPrice gets printed out in the console (150) because it's defined in the scope of the discountPrices using var.  
3. Same as above, except this time finalPrice isn't defined using var. It prints out 150 because even without the var because the variable finalPrice will still ignore the block it's in (the for loop), which allows it to be used in the scope of the discountPrices function.
4. The function returns the list [ 50, 100, 150 ]. We know that all the variables in the discountPrices exist in the scope of the function itself. What happens is that the function will loop through all variables in the prices list and change them to their discounted value based on the discount value.
